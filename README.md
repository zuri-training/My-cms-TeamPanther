# My-cms-TeamPanther

## A platform that allows users spin up a basic website - and allows as much customizations as possible.

This project is in line with the stepwise Milestones and tasks provided by the Zuri Instructors and Mentors and so far, as at the 7th of December, 2022; it contains the following:

- Definition of a start folder structure for our project.
- Initialized project folders
- Initialized base project files (some of which are empty for the time-being).
- Initialized npm packages (see in package.json)
- A .gitignore file to exclude heavy object collections like node_nodules
- A .env file to store some private variables
- A server.js application that we propose to use if necessary, as an HTTP server for the website.

## NOTICE

Project is still ongoing.

## Issues

Yet to populate the base files and folders. These issues will be resolved as time goes on.

# Module for Authentication

This module contains relevant files to describe the flow of our authentication. We created two routes, Login and Registration.
We also connected to a database (MongoDB). To test, start the index.js in the authentication branch with 'npm run dev'. Try to create a user and validate by logging in

## Contents

- Base Web Server (app.js [secondary] & index.js [main]) with login, and registration routes created.
- Basic definition of user schema model. (More fields will be added).
- Email validation with validator package from npm
- JWT authentication and authorization beta implementations with jasonwenbtoken package from npm
- MongoDB database connection
- Authentication middleware

# Issues

- On the main branch, we will use one server app, server.js. We are yet to implement that.
